				SHELTER brings unique & innovative approach in tackling the on-going humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				It aims to boost not only the large & small organizations that are doing humanitarian effort, but most especially it empowers the individuals & small groups who are most in need by connecting them directly to the people who has the resources.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				With the use blockchain technology, smart contract & inter-planetary-file-system(IPFS), we now have the ability to transact & track resources with high level of trust,security & authenticity.
				These capabilities ultimately enables our relief effort to be more effective, more flexible & impactful all while remaining immutable & cencorship resistant.
				
				 <br/>
				 <br/>

				 Shelter also aims to build its own relief-team & relief-fund called "GUARDIANS" that will organize humanitarian efforts on the ground.
				 these teams along with the resources at Shelter's own inventory will be governed by the ShelterDAO.
