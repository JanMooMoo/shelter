## About Shelter
Shelter is a secure, immutable & decentralized donation platform that aims to maximize the reach & further improve the impact of our humanitarian relief effort. It uses a BLOCKCHAIN-BASED TICKETING SYSTEM that lets refugees & people affected by the war in Ukraine connect,exchange & get donations directly from people that wants to help.
<br />
<br />
One of the distrupting features of Shelter is the unique use of tickets. In Shelter, tickets are used primarily to exchange not only goods & items essential to the victims of war, but also services amongst its members. Event organizers could also use shelter to make humanitarian events such as food programs, online medical consultation & community events & leverage the secure & immutable ticketing system of the platform.
